Visualize Graphs as a 2D or 3D (later on!) using a Web-socket API to interact with any language that talks HTTP 1.1

and knows how to serialize data on base64!

** motivation

wish to see some graphs and under a good not bloated API to use any data and see its relations, remember graphviz but the interface is not the best.. and not even the most usual... so I wish for something that can improve the experience on viewing data on an agnostic language and data format way, as graphs

Also, I need this to see the data inside an RDF/Turtle file format... in a nice way, of course!
