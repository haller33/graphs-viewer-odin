#+title: Thoughts

* requirements

** the interface

the interface must work as well on curl comand as well as a JAVA or JS http request

the only requerement is the 'data' been encoded on base64, for the propose of do not have do deal with this kind of stuff

below are a snipped pseud-code for exemplo of usage of the 'API'

#+begin_src bash
cat data.db
    | awk "{print $1}"
    | base64
    | xargs -I '{}' curl  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
                        --request POST \
                        --data '{"nodeA":"'{}'","nodeB":"A"}' \
                        localhost:3333
#+end_src

this sould be the interface, with even curl can send data on a bash script from a file of any format.

also the data must be base64 to not have to deal with XML parsing or decoding, just dealing with internal variables and then display

But all data on Base64 must be only ASCII-only data, and the Base64 encoded as well.

** later on

integration to couchdb api to deal with ruge data sets,
concurrency with concurrentqueue.cpp

a gui using the raygui library (for now on!)
